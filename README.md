Information about the Sleeping Beauty Paradox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem

My code simulates this paradox and calculates the probability that Sleeping Beauty guesses the coin flip accurately on any given day.
My code also simulates my variation of this scenario where Sleeping Beauty gets paid a $1 every time they guess heads and the coin flip is heads, and $0.50 every time they guess tails and the coin flip is tails.

The probability that the coin flip is heads when sleeping beauty wakes up is 1 / 3. However, in my variation of this scenario, Sleeping Beauty always makes an average of $0.50 regardless of how often they select heads or tails
